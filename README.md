where

    ATT = Number of passing attempts
    CMP = Number of completions
    YDS = Passing yards
    TD = Touchdown passes
    INT = Interceptions

$${\displaystyle d=2.375-\left({{\text{INT}} \over {\text{ATT}}}\times 25\right)}$$
If the result of any calculation is greater than 2.375, it is set to 2.375. If the result is a negative number, it is set to zero.

Then, the above calculations are used to complete the passer rating:
